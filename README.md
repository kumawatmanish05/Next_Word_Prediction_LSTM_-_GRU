# 🧠 Next Word Prediction Using LSTM & GRU  
A deep learning NLP project that predicts the next possible word in a sentence using **LSTM** and **GRU** architectures.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview
Next-word prediction is a core NLP task used in chatbots, auto-completion systems, writing assistants, and more.  
This project builds and compares **LSTM** and **GRU** models for accurate text generation.

## 📦 Project Workflow

### 1️⃣ Data Preparation
- Cleaned and normalized text  
- Tokenized words  
- Created padded sequences for training  

### 2️⃣ Model Building
Two deep-learning architectures trained:

#### 🔹 LSTM Model
- Embedding layer  
- LSTM  
- Dense output layer  

#### 🔹 GRU Model
- Embedding layer  
- GRU  
- Dense output layer  

### 3️⃣ Training & Evaluation
- Trained with categorical crossentropy  
- Compared training speed, accuracy, and prediction quality  

### 4️⃣ Prediction
Models generate the next word based on input text.
